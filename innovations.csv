"LENDING PARAMETERS, A CAUSE FOR REDUCED CUSTOMER RETENTION RATE",Financial Inclusion,"Stanbic bank zambia has experience a daunting reduction in the customer retention rate resulting in stunted  growth rate in our branch network NII in particular. Then PBB recorded K 178,631,261 in the first quarter of 2020 compared to K190,560,406, of the first quarter of 2021. We are cognizant of the fact that there is a growth rate of 6.26%. However, this growth rate is considered for a bank whose client base grows on a daily basis. In the case of Kabwe branch particularly, there has been a reduction in the NII figures from K8,067,367 in the first quarter of 2020 to K4,117,721 in the first quarter of 2021. This translates into a 48.96% decrease. The branch contributed 4.52% of the networks NII as of the first quarter of 2020 and 2.2% to NII first quarter of 2021 respectively. This can be attributed to the fact that we have an average of three(3) clients paying off their loan on a daily basis going to other financial institutions. Others are just changing pay points due to stringent lending parameters effected by the bank.
Currently, our lending parameters, and to the disadvantage of an ordinary customer stand at:
1. No loan refinancing due to purported financial misconduct. 
2. Increased ITI
3. Minimum net income greater or equal to K5,000 (New to Borrow)
4. Scraping off of salary advances (smart mahafu)
5. Increased net income for redraws or top ups (greater or equal to K4,000)
6. High interest rates",,Evaluated

StanMobile,Customer experience,"In the recent shift of interaction dynamics with customers and non-customers, the Bank has experienced increased traffic of calls and emails in our Call Centre which has overloaded our Agents.  Further customer frustration has been recorded many times when they are unable to get through to an agent or do not have airtime to a call through the Call Centre and hence only have an option of getting to a Branch.

Automated KYC Documentation Submission App/Link/System,Centralised KYC Database,"1. Current KYC documentation collection process involves someone manually checking a client's missing or expired documentation, informing the Relationship Management team/Branch who then informs the client, the client has to then come into the bank to deliver KYC documentation or send it via email. Relationship Management team/Branch staff have to then certify the document and scan it onto DSX. This is a tedious and costly process that involves a lot of manpower and paper.

2. New clients have to manually bring physical documents to the branch for new account opening, these documents have to then be scanned onto DSX. Due to workload it may take time for the branch to scan the documents  and at times documents are scanned in the wrong pocket. 

3. For account changes such as agent addition, changes in signatory, joint account or Pacra changes among others, the client has to deliver these documents to the bank in person or via email. There are instances when these updates are not scanned onto DSX on time hence causing causing client delays and terrible customer experience

Summary
  - Ensure up to date documents on customer mandate 
-  Managing the misplacement of submitted documents
- Streamlining the process from a customer submitting the documents, to them being uploaded onto the database 
- Cost reduction in the KYC documentation collection process. The app will help redeploy manpower that is currently focusing on KYC to various sales roles to help increase revenue. Other reduced costs will include; Paper, printing, and scanning costs

Stanbic Digital Stamps,Customer experience,"Wasting paper by printing instructions and then scanning and sending back to the processing units. This has proved to a very cumbersome process as there is duplication of work and a lot of time is wasted. The digital stamps will reduce of the amount of paper that is printed as well as the time spent on reviewing and scanning the documents. This means the bank will spend less on bond paper and this will also mean the bank will spend less on Toner. Moreover, those working from home will not need to come to office to print and stamp instructions but can be done at their work stations resulting in reduced traffic at Head office. It would also be beneficial for customer experience as the turn around time would be quicker.",,Pending evaluation
